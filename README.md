# dotfiles

My terminal configuration files.

Designed for use with GNU stow.

## Install

First get GNU stow installed.

```
brew install stow
```

Then clone the repo into your `$HOME` directory.

Navigate to the dotfiles repo directory, and pick which app you want to install.
In this case we'll do nvim. Run

```
stow nvim
```
